#About
BitNotes went Live on 23rd April, 2016. As Indian Institute of Information Technology is famous for lot of creative work, again in 2016 to promote this Culture, IIITA organized Hack In the North largest student organized Hackathon in India. BitNotes is fruit of Hack In the North. BitNotes is platform for sharing Practicals, Assignments, Papers, Class Notes etc with community of student who are always tested with submission deadlines, practical completions. We believe sharing above stuff is more about happiness and satisfaction which comes out helping each other. We believe sharing is solution to lot of issues in the chaotic world. When we share, we spread happiness, we tie new relations of brotherhood with unknown people. We are fascinated by idea of people helping each other with whatever resources that could simplify each other problems. This ties new relation between students of different institutes, leading to concurrence of different teaching techniques at single platform. That sounds really cool, we are able to access resources of vast spread universities of world with ease. Someone may think how this is helpful to creator or those who uploads, we provide them with incentive/money for creating useful resources to our platform. More subscriber the publicaion(Creator's Publishing Channel) have, more views to their shared resources leads to more incentive (Quite simple!).
